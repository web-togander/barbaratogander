      Over the years I have been building an architectural perspective of music, its sonic arrangement in space and its relationship as a construction, both in acoustic space or in  1D as the view of a multitrack on a screen or a score on a sheet of paper. On one hand because I am a vocalist and the acoustic behavior of the instrument, how frequencies travel inside the vocal box is especially fascinating to me. On the other hand, I like to visualize the composition as a construction; sound and silence as full and empty, concrete and space. <br>
      Meeting Rosario Murúa, architect and VJ, allowed me to take that relationship to another level where sound and visuals invite us to take a journey through spaces that are constantly articulated and deconstructed. This also gave us the opportunity to convene works of very admired architects such as Itala Fulvio and her incredible underground cemetery in Chacarita, Buenos Aires.
