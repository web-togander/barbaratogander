      M³ is a platform created to empower, elevate, normalize and give visibility to women and non-binary musicians and those of other historically underrepresented gender identities in intersection with race, sexuality, or ability worldwide. <br>
      I was very lucky to be part of the 3rd Cohort (Summer Solstice 2021) and together with guitarist and composer Ria Modak composed the piece “People of many lands”.
